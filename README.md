# ðŸ‘‹ Hi Everyone 

My name is Vincent Chan. I am an electronic engineer in Hong Kong and I am also a member of IET. Currently, I am working on robotic vision and deep learning research. Vision guided control system using pointcloud and depth camera is my main focus in the current research. Meanwhile, I am also a NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute certified instructor in the University. Therefore, you can also look for some teaching materials here as well.
